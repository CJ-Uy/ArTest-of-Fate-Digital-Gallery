            <p>
                The ArTest-of-Fate competition is an sub-event within the PSHS-EVC SportsFest 2022, 
                The Fray in the Threads of Fate, that is dedicated to displaying the artistic young talents we have in PSHS-EVC. 
                The entries are displayed in a virtual gallery to be appreciated by the public. PSHS-EVC students will be able to
                vote by rating the submissions which will contribute with helping us choose the wineers! We will be choosing
                the winners through the student body's votes and the assesment of our judges with a 20:80 stake respectively.
                Finally, the winners will be awarded prize money and be recognized in the closing ceremony.
